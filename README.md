Puplication in Persuasive Technology (pp. 7182).

We present Bet4EcoDrive, an in-car app, which intends to persuade drivers to change their driving behavior towards an economical driving style. This is achieved by suggesting the driver to bet that (s)he can reach a predefined goal. In our study scenario, the driver can bet to stay within a certain RPM range to avoid driving at high revs and, thus, to reduce fuel consumption. We have implemented Bet4EcoDrive as an Android-based smartphone app, which can be connected to the vehicle via ODB-II over Bluetooth, in order to read car data (e.g., RPM). It provides feedback of the actual state while driving through different visualizations. An exploratory in-situ study with five participants proves the feasibility of our approach. The results show that participants were persuaded to reduce average RPM values while driving by the desire to win the bet.
