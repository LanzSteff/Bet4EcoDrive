# README #

This is a Readme for an inCar Android Bet Application.

To use git you have to install git on your OS. Google it for your OS (windows, mac, linux, ...).

To checkout the repository create a new folder 'bet4ecodrive' and jump into it, then use your shell (or on windows git bash) to execute this command:

* git clone https://LanzSteff@bitbucket.org/LanzSteff/bet4ecodrive.git

Now you shall got your project in this folder and be able to import it into your eclipse IDE.

If you want to commit your files, execute the following:

* git add file (you can also use normal linux syntax like * if you want to add every thing, etc.)

* git commit -m 'commit message'

* git push origin master


If you want to get the latest stuff from the repository, execute the following:

* git pull

To avoid conflicts please always pull the newest stuff from the repository before you start to change and push files to the repo.

Good luck :-)

Cheers,
Steff
